uploadr.py-for-python-3
=======================

Taken from <https://github.com/joelmx/flickrUploadr/blob/master/python3/uploadr.py> 
and modified to work with Python 3.3.

The changes were mostly replacing xmltramp with ElementTree and altering the POST data 
for urllib.request.Request to work with a mixture of binary and string data.

Add an API key and secret and you're good to go.
